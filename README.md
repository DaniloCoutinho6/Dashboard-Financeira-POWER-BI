A financial analysis dashboard developed in Power BI provides a comprehensive and detailed view of a company's key financial metrics. The project includes a custom cover page, highlighting the title and visual identity, followed by an overview page featuring key indicators such as profit, expenses, and revenue, presented clearly and intuitively.

Additionally, the dashboard includes detailed pages where data is organized and analyzed by months and years, enabling an in-depth understanding of variations over time. Visual elements such as waterfall charts to demonstrate profit composition, donut charts for expense and revenue proportions, and dynamic tables for detailed period comparisons are utilized. This approach facilitates strategic decision-making, ensuring clarity and accuracy in financial analysis.
